# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Deep Learning

![ANPR Demo](link-to-anpr-demo.gif)

Welcome to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project! This repository contains a powerful and efficient ANPR system that utilizes Deep Learning and image processing techniques to detect and recognize license plates from images.

## Features

- State-of-the-art deep learning model based on InceptionResNetV2.
- Integration with pytesseract for accurate text extraction.
- Easy-to-use codebase for license plate detection and recognition.
- Pre-trained model weights included (object_detection.h5).

## Demo

[View Demo](link-to-live-demo) to see the ANPR system in action.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANPR-Project.git
   cd ANPR-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run ANPR**

   - Use `ANPR.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook for interactive usage.
   - Use `python main.py --input path/to/your/image.jpg` for command-line usage.

4. **Enjoy Automatic Number Plate Recognition!**

## Example Usage

```python
from anpr import ANPR
anpr = ANPR()
result = anpr.recognize_plate('path/to/your/image.jpg')
print(result)
```
