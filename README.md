Welcome to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project! This repository contains a powerful and efficient ANPR system that utilizes Deep Learning and image processing techniques to detect and recognize license plates from images.

## Features

- State-of-the-art deep learning model based on InceptionResNetV2.
- Integration with pytesseract for accurate text extraction.
- Easy-to-use codebase for license plate detection and recognition.
- Pre-trained model weights included (object_detection.h5).
